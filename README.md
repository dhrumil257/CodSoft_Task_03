# CodSoft_Task_03
# Objective: 
  In this data science project, the goal is to predict future sales for product and service- 
  based businesses. The prediction factors include advertising expenditures, audience 
  segmentation, and advertising platforms.

  # Scope: 
  Sales prediction is a critical tool for businesses, aiding in decision-making related to 
  advertising costs and strategies. The project employs Python for machine learning to 
  forecast 
  future sales.

  #Key Components:
  
  Advertising Expenditure Analysis:Explore the impact of advertising costs on sales 
  predictions.
  
  Audience Segmentation: How different audience segments contribute to variations in sales.
  
  Platform Influence: The role of advertising platforms in shaping sales outcomes.
  
  Implementation:Python will be the primary tool for implementing machine learning models. 
  
  Techniques such as regression analysis and predictive modeling will be employed.
  
  #Outcome:
  The project aims to deliver a robust sales prediction model, enabling businesses to make 
  data-driven decisions, optimize advertising strategies, and enhance operational efficiency.

  #Conclusion: 
  In the dynamic landscape of product and service-based businesses, the ability to forecast 
  sales is paramount. This project, undertaken during the data science internship at 
  CodSoft, delved into the realm of sales prediction using machine learning with Python. 
  
  Some of the key findings:-
  
  Insights and Observations:Sales exhibit a positive correlation with both TV and Radio 
  advertising expenses, signifying the effectiveness of these channels.
  
  Notably, there's a strong correlation between TV advertising expenses and sales, 
  emphasizing the impact of TV advertising on driving sales.
  
  The R2 score, chosen as the evaluation metric, showcased the accuracy of the model in 
  predicting sales. 
  
  The Random Forest model emerged as the preferred choice, achieving an impressive 99% 
  training accuracy and 95% testing accuracy.
